# PingPongAssembly16Bits
A game destined for one or 2 players which resembles the old ping pong application. Used software interrupts to generate pixels.

# Description
The game works by detecting a collision. Whenever the ball touches a paddle, its velocity changes the direction. When a left or a right wall is hit,
the ball changes the orientation. The ball is a rectangle made of pixels, as well as the paddles. 
The user has 2 ways to play: either alone, or with another player. 'A' and 'D' are used by the first player, '4' and '6' are used by the second player.
At the end, a window with the winner will be displayed. 'R' is for restarting the game and 'M' to return to the main menu.
